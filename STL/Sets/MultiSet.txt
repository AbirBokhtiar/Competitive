1. Contains duplicate elements but maintains sorted order.
2. All operations are performed in O(logn) like multiset.

**Code**

int main()
{
   multiset<string> ms;
   ms={"ab","bc","ca","de","ab"};
   auto it= ms.find("gf");
   if(it!=ms.end()){ms.erase(it);} //erase the one it is pointing
   else{ms.erase("ab");}  //erase all the same value
   for(auto value: ms){
    cout<<value<<endl;
   }
}
